# Reskillable Reimagined

Reskillable is an RPG-style progression mod that introduces a **skill-based locking and leveling system** for Minecraft.  
Players must earn experience and level up skills in order to use powerful gear, defeat strong enemies, and access advanced content.

This guide covers the **entire system**, including skills, perks, configs, commands, and customization options.

---

## 🔥 Core Features

Reskillable adds:

- A full **skill leveling system**
- **Gear gating** by player skill level
- **Entity attack requirements** (mobs can require skill levels to damage)
- **Crafting requirements**
- A modular **perk system**
- Configurable **attribute bonuses**
- XP-scaling and level progression
- Full datapack-style JSON customization

---

## 🎯 Skill System

Each player has multiple skills they can level up using experience.

### Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Attack** | Controls ability to use weapons and defeat strong enemies |
| **Defense** | Controls armor usage and survivability |
| **Mining** | Controls use of mining tools |
| **Gathering** | Controls use of gathering tools like shovels & axes |
| **Farming** | Controls hoe/tool usage for crops |
| **Building** | Controls building-related actions (block reach, etc.) |
| **Agility** | Grants movement and mobility perks |
| **Magic** | Controls magical items & spell-based gear |

---

## 📈 Leveling & XP System

- Players spend XP to upgrade skills via the skills menu.
- XP cost scales dynamically using both:
  - Predefined XP scaling curves
  - A configurable multiplier

### XP Scaling
- XP requirements scale similarly to vanilla Minecraft levels.
- XP progression beyond level 50 uses a fallback scaling system.
- Fully configurable using:

```
xpScalingMultiplier
levelsPerHeart
healthPerHeart
maximumLevel
```

---

## 💥 Attribute Bonuses

Every **5 levels** in a skill grants permanent bonuses.

These bonuses are configurable via the config.

### Example Bonuses

| Skill | Bonus |
|------|-------|
| **Attack** | Extra attack damage |
| **Defense** | Extra armor + armor toughness |
| **Agility** | Movement speed |
| **Magic** | Custom attribute (configurable ID) |
| **Building** | Block reach distance |
| **Gathering** | Bonus XP gain |
| **Mining** | Mining speed |
| **Farming** | Crop growth chance |

All of these are adjustable via config.

---

## 🧩 Perk System

At certain levels, skills unlock **perks** that modify gameplay.

Examples:
- Increase movement speed  
- Bonus mining reach  
- Extra block break power  
- Faster gathering speed  
- Magical attribute boosts  

Perks can be toggled and updated dynamically.

---

## 🛠 Skill Locking System

Reskillable can restrict:

✅ Item usage  
✅ Entity attacks  
✅ Crafting recipes  

By skill level.

### 1. Item Skill Restrictions

Controlled by:
```
config/reskillable/skill_locks.json
```

Example:
```json
{
  "skillLocks": {
    "minecraft:diamond_sword": ["attack:15"],
    "minecraft:netherite_chestplate": ["defense:30"]
  }
}
```

Meaning:
- You need **Attack 15** to use a diamond sword.
- You need **Defense 30** for netherite armor.

---

### 2. Entity Attack Restrictions

You can restrict attacking mobs:

```
config/reskillable/attack_skill_locks.json
```

Example:
```json
{
  "attackSkillLocks": {
    "minecraft:warden": ["attack:25"]
  }
}
```

If your skill is too low:
- You do no damage
- Or reduced damage (depending on config)

---

### 3. Craft Skill Restrictions

Crafting can also be locked:

```
config/reskillable/craft_skill_locks.json
```

You can make crafting recipes require certain skill levels.

---

---

## 🧠 Magic Skill Integration
